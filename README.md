# UnityServer
A little multi-user system for use in my games. It will be based on the idea that the server has the final say in the position of all objects.

# ProtoBuf Object Serialization
This server uses ProtoBuf serialization for sending objects via RPC.

# Commands
This server system implements a modular command system that will(NYI) allow for commands to be added easily. It will have support of permission groups.
